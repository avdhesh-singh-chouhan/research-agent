## 🎯 Demo Strategies

### Show the Full Range

**3-Step Demo Flow:**

1. **Start with DECLINED** → 🍕 Joe's Pizza
   - High-risk restaurant industry
   - Moderate financials (680 credit, 35% debt ratio)
   - Only 3 years old
   - **Result**: Likely declined or heavy conditions
   - **Shows**: System can reject risky applications

2. **Middle Ground** → 🚗 Autobell or 🎯 Target
   - Established businesses with good credit
   - Some concerns (industry risk, debt levels)
   - **Result**: Approved with conditions
   - **Shows**: Nuanced risk assessment

3. **Finish with APPROVAL** → 💼 Accenture plc (Fortune 500)
   - $64B revenue, 750K employees
   - Perfect credit (850), low debt (15%)
   - 35 years in business
   - **Result**: Clean approval
   - **Shows**: System handles enterprise-scale loans

### Test Real Businesses

The system uses **Exa API for live research**, so you can analyze ANY real business:

- Enter actual company names
- Exa finds real website, news, reviews
- Business Verifier matches data against public records
- **Try**: Local restaurants, retail stores, service businesses

### Highlight Key Features

- **Parallel Execution**: All 3 agents work simultaneously (15-30 seconds)
- **Real Data Sources**: Exa API searches, OpenCorporates verification
- **Transparent**: See exactly what each agent is checking
- **Fraud Detection**: System caught mismatched Accenture data (before fix)
- **Scalability**: Handles $50K to $500M+ loans

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Port already in use:**
```bash
# Change PORT in .env file
PORT=3001
```

**API Keys not working:**
- Verify keys in `.env` file
- Ensure `.env` is in root directory
- Restart backend server after changes

**Frontend can't connect to backend:**
- Ensure backend is running on port 3000
- Check Vite proxy config in `frontend/vite.config.ts`

## 📝 Notes

- **API Costs**: Uses Claude API and Exa API (monitor usage)
- **Rate Limits**: Exa free tier has 1000 searches/month
- **Analysis Time**: Typically 10-15 seconds (agents run in parallel)
- **Data Privacy**: No data is stored; all processing is real-time

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add more agents (Fraud Detector, Compliance Checker)
- [ ] Integrate with real credit APIs
- [ ] Add document upload (PDFs, financial statements)
- [ ] Export reports to PDF
- [ ] Historical tracking and analytics
- [ ] A/B testing different agent configurations
